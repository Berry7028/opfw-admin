# legacy-rp-admin-v3
A web interface to help with administrative duties at the FiveM server: Legacy Roleplay. The backend is written in PHP using [Laravel Framework](https://laravel.com/), while the frontend consists of [EmberJS](https://emberjs.com/).

See [#contributing](#Contributing) for more details on how you can help shape **legacy-rp-admin**. We're always down to improve and receive feedback.

## Improvements from v1
1. Application is now a SOP (Single Page Application), meaning that navigating and interacting with the site will feel much more pleasant and natural. 
2. Re-done to give a more minimalistic and "simple" look.
3. Backend improvements that encourage scaling and maintainability. 
4. More.
